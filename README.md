# BASIC Game Programming

## Run it...

`cargo run`

## What does it do?

Nothing much really. It just scrapes the AtariArchives.org site's BASIC Computer Games page.

The pages of the BASIC Computer Games book are provided via gif image files. This app gets

those images and saves them so you can view them locally in folder "./pages". The folder

will be created if it doesn't already exist.
